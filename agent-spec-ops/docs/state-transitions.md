## Per-Task State Transitions

Every task must move through its lane state machine using
`scripts/transition-task.js`. Do **not** edit `task.status` directly in the
state file.

```bash
node scripts/transition-task.js runs/<DELIVERY_ID>/workflow-state.json <TASK_ID> <STATUS> "[NOTE]"
```

### Task Lane Transitions

```
planned  ──→ active ──→ implemented ──→ testing ──→ verified
  │          │              │               │
  └──→ blocked              └──→ failed ────┘
       waived
       not_applicable
```

### Rules Per Transition

- **planned → active**: All dependencies (`depends_on`) must be `verified`,
  `not_applicable`, or `waived`. WIP=1 enforced per role lane — only one
  `active` task per lane at a time.

- **active → implemented**: Code is written. Changed files and implementation
  evidence must be recorded in `task.implementation`.

- **implemented → testing**: Tests are running or ready to run.

- **testing → verified**: Test execution evidence AND Git lifecycle must be complete:
  - `task.test.status` must be `"passed"` (recorded via `scripts/record-test-results.js`)
  - `task.test.last_run_at` must be set (tests were actually executed, not just claimed)
  - `task.test.commands` must contain at least one command
  - `task.test.failures` must be empty
  - `git_flow.local_tests_passed = true` with `test_evidence`
  - `git_flow.pushed = true` with `push_evidence`
  - `git_flow.merge_request_status` is `created`, `open`, or `merged` with URL
  - If `auto_merge = true`: `merge_checks_passed` and `merged` must be true

  Agents cannot skip test execution by setting `git_flow.local_tests_passed = true`
  directly — the `transition-task.js` script now requires `task.test` to have been
  populated via `record-test-results.js`. Always use `record-test-results.js` to
  record test outcomes.

- **any → failed**: Records failure in `task.loop.last_failure` and increments
  attempt counter. After `max_attempts` retries, escalate via `blocked`.

- **any → blocked**: Stops work on this task. Requires a blocker description.

### Top-Level State Correlation

The top-level workflow state updates automatically when tasks transition:

| When all frontend tasks are... | Top-level state advances to |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `active` or `implemented` | `frontend_dev` |
| `testing` | `frontend_test` |
| `verified` | `frontend_verified` |
| `verified` (and backend done) | `integration_verification` |

| When all backend tasks are... | Top-level state advances to |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `active` or `implemented` | `backend_dev` |
| `testing` | `backend_test` |
| `verified` | `backend_verified` |
| `verified` (and frontend done) | `integration_verification` |

Use `scripts/transition.js` only for non-implementation transitions
(intake through delivery plan approval, integration_verification through done).
For implementation lane work, always use `scripts/transition-task.js`.

Do **not** use `scripts/transition.js` to jump from `implementation_in_progress`
straight to `integration_verification` — this bypasses lane sub-states and will
be rejected if dev tasks are unverified.

### Knowledge Improvement Gate

Starting from `integration_verification`, the state machine now requires a
`knowledge_improvement` step before `waiting_for_final_review`:

```
integration_verification → knowledge_improvement → waiting_for_final_review
```

Transition to `knowledge_improvement` after integration checks pass. This state
is the signal to promote reusable knowledge cards and sync knowledge to Linear.
The `transition.js` script automatically syncs knowledge to Linear when entering
`knowledge_improvement` or `waiting_for_final_review` (if `LINEAR_API_KEY` is set).

After promoting knowledge and syncing to Linear, transition to
`waiting_for_final_review`:

## State Field Maintenance

> [!WARNING]
> **Session Compaction Warning**
> DO NOT rely on conversational memory for API keys, user instructions, or state flags. The chat history will inevitably be truncated to save tokens, erasing anything not permanently saved.
> You MUST persist all data to `workflow-state.json`.
> **CRITICAL**: Do NOT manually edit the JSON file with string replacement tools (this will corrupt the file). ALWAYS use the `record-event.js` script with the `--set` flag:
> `node scripts/record-event.js runs/<DELIVERY_ID>/workflow-state.json --type config_update --summary "Update state" --set "path.to.field=value"`

You MUST keep `workflow-state.json` fields current after every meaningful
action. The monitor UI reads these fields — stale state misleads both human
reviewers and future agent sessions.

### Checklist: fields to update and when

| Field | When to update | How |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| `tool_readiness.choices.product_tracker` | After tool readiness check | Via `check-tool-readiness.js` or `record-event.js --set` |
| `tool_readiness.choices.code_host` | After tool readiness check | Via `check-tool-readiness.js` or `record-event.js --set` |
| `tool_readiness.status` | After tool readiness check + human approval | Via `transition.js` |
| `token-usage.csv` (via `record-token-usage.js`) | After each agent run, task, eval, or tool-heavy segment | `node scripts/record-token-usage.js ...` |
| `task.git_flow.*` | After each git step (branch, test, push, MR, merge) | Via `record-event.js --set` — see Dev Git Lifecycle table |
| `task.implementation.changed_files` | After implementation | Via `record-event.js --set` |
| `task.implementation.evidence` | After implementation | Via `record-event.js --set` |
| `task.test.*` | After running tests | Via `record-test-results.js` |
| `task.status` | On each lane transition | **Always** via `transition-task.js` (never edit directly) |
| `state.current_state` | Auto-updated by `transition-task.js` | Check it after transitions |
| `memory.*` | After events, evals, remarks | Via respective record scripts |
| `delivery.updated_at` | On any change | Auto-set by scripts, or set manually |
| `artifacts.*` | After generating artifacts | Via artifact scripts or `record-event.js --set` |
| `human_instructions.*` | When sending/finalizing review instructions | Via `record-event.js --set` |
| `gates.*` | When human approves/denies a gate | Via `record-event.js --set` |

(Use `scripts/transition-task.js` for task status changes).

### Token usage must be recorded regularly — enforced at verified

**This is now enforced.** The `testing → verified` transition requires at
least one non-zero token usage row for the task. If you skip token recording,
the transition will be rejected.

After every task implementation, test run, eval, or tool-heavy segment, record
actual token counts:

```bash
node scripts/record-token-usage.js runs/<DELIVERY_ID>/workflow-state.json \
  --scope task --task <TASK_ID> \
  --input-tokens <N> --output-tokens <N> --total-cost-usd <N> --cost-basis actual
```

If the runtime exposes token counts per API call, record them immediately
after the call. If it only exposes per-session or per-run totals, record a
cumulative row at the end of the session.

If the runtime does not expose per-call token counts, record an estimated
row at task boundaries so the monitor shows non-zero usage:

```bash
node scripts/record-token-usage.js runs/<DELIVERY_ID>/workflow-state.json \
  --scope task --task <TASK_ID> \
  --total-tokens <N> --total-cost-usd <N> --cost-basis estimated \
  --notes "Estimated from session totals"
```

### Context recovery at session start

When resuming an existing delivery, always run context recovery first:

```bash
node scripts/read-context.js runs/<DELIVERY_ID>/workflow-state.json
```

This dumps current state, task summary, Linear mappings, token totals,
tool readiness, and gate status. If any fields appear stale (e.g., old
timestamps, zero token counts after known work), update them before
proceeding.
